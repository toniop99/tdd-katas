# Fizz Buzz Kata

## Task
- Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
- Usually just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number

**Happy coding**!
